	abstract = {Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a grassroots movement protesting violence towards Black individuals and communities with a focus on police brutality. The movement has gained significant media and political attention following the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake in 2020 [1]. Due to its decentralized nature, the #BlackLivesMatter social media hashtag has come to both represent the movement and been used as a call to action. Similar hashtags have appeared to counter the BLM movement, such as #AllLivesMatter and #Blue-LivesMatter. We introduce a data set of 41.8 million tweets from 10 million users which contain one of the following keywords: BlackLivesMatter, AllLivesMatter and BlueLivesMatter 1. This data set contains all currently available tweets from the beginning of the BLM movement in 2013 to June 2020. We summarize the data set and show temporal trends in use of both the BlackLivesMatter keyword and keywords associated with counter movements. In the past, similarly themed, though much smaller in scope, BLM data sets have been used for studying discourse in protest and counter protest movements [2, 3], predicting retweets [4], examining the role of social media in protest movements [5, 6] and exploring narrative agency [7]. This paper open-sources a large-scale data set to facilitate research in the areas of computational social science, communications, political science, natural language processing, and machine learning.}

	abstract = {The recent wave of mobilizations in the Arab world and across Western countries has generated much discussion on how digital media is connected to the diffusion of protests. We examine that connection using data from the surge of mobilizations that took place in Spain in May 2011. We study recruitment patterns in the Twitter network and find evidence of social influence and complex contagion. We identify the network position of early participants (i.e. the leaders of the recruitment process) and of the users who acted as seeds of message cascades (i.e. the spreaders of information). We find that early participants cannot be characterized by a typical topological position but spreaders tend to be more central in the network. These findings shed light on the connection between online networks, social contagion, and collective dynamics, and offer an empirical test to the recruitment mechanisms theorized in formal models of collective action.}

Quarantine has a huge impact and can cause considerable psychological strain. The present study aims to establish the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress in the general population. An online survey was administered from 18–22 March 2020 to 2766 participants. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to examine the associations between sociodemographic variables; personality traits; depression, anxiety, and stress. Female gender, negative affect, and detachment were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Having an acquaintance infected was associated with increased levels of both depression and stress, whereas a history of stressful situations and medical problems was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Finally, those with a family member infected and young person who had to work outside their domicile presented higher levels of anxiety and stress, respectively. This epidemiological picture is an important benchmark for identifying persons at greater risk of suffering from psychological distress and the results are useful for tailoring psychological interventions targeting the post-traumatic nature of the distress.</p>}

	abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.}

We found that GSDMM can infer the number of clusters automatically with a good balance between the completeness and homogeneity of the clustering results, and is fast to converge.

	abstract = {Clustering is a fundamental task in data mining and knowledge discovery. The most widely used technique for clustering is the k-means algorithm, which is dependent on the choice number of clusters, k. In unsupervised situations, the choice of an appropriate value for k is difficult. To overcome this challenge, validity measures attempt to determine how accurately the clusters reflect the data. However, numerous validity measures proliferate, and different measures often produce disparate results. This paper reports an experiment to evaluate commonly used cluster validity measures, including Dunn, Davies-Bouldin, Calinski-Harabasz, Silhouette, Point Bi-serial, PBM, and Sum-of-Squares. These measures were applied to k-means clusterings of 125 artificially generated data sets. The Sum-of-Squares method was found to be the most effective for predicting an appropriate value for k. Silhouette was found to be a good alternative, and Calinski-Harabasz and Davies-Bouldin both made only moderate showings compared to the other two. Dunn, Point Bi-serial, and PBM performed quite poorly. The results also suggest that validity measures could be used as explanatory tools in their own right.}

This paper uses visualization methods to reveal these structural signatures and regression analysis to confirm the relationship between these signatures and their associated roles in Usenet newsgroups. Our analysis focuses on distinguishing the signatures of one role from others, the role of “answer people." Answer people are individuals whose dominant behavior is to respond to questions posed by other users. We found that answer people predominantly contribute one or a few messages to discussions initiated by others, are disproportionately tied to relative isolates, have few intense ties and have few triangles in their local networks. OLS regression shows that these signatures are strongly correlated with role behavior and, in combination, provide a strongly predictive model for identifying role behavior (R2=.72). To conclude, we consider strategies for further improving the identification of role behavior in online discussion settings and consider how the development of a taxonomy of author types could be extended to a taxonomy of newsgroups in particular and discussion systems in general.}

All tweets containing the hashtag #CPC, representing the Conservative Party of Canada (government), and #NDP, representing the New Democratic Party of Canada (official opposition), were collected over a 2-week period in March 2013 and a follower network graph was created. Social network analysis and content analysis were employed to identify influentials. Kendall’s τ was the primary quantitative measure for comparison. Categorization of Twitter profiles of users found within the top 20 most influential lists, according to each metric of influence, made up the qualitative portion of analysis. The authors find that measures of centrality—indegree and eigenvector centrality—identify the traditional political elite (media outlets, journalists, politicians) as influential, whereas measures considering the quality of messages and interactions provide a different group of influencers, including political commentators and bloggers. Finally, the authors investigate the possibility of using the local clustering coefficient of nodes to identify those who are both aware of the traditional elite and embedded in tightly knit communities, similar to the “opinion leader,” described in the Two-Step Flow Hypothesis.}

Many methods of harvesting useful information from social networks’ immense amounts of user-generated data have been successfully applied to such real-world topics as politics and marketing, to name just a few. This study presents a novel twist on two popular techniques for studying OSNs: community detection and sentiment analysis. Using sentiment classification to enhance community detection and community partitions to permit more in-depth analysis of sentiment data, these two techniques are brought together to analyze four networks from the Twitter OSN. The Twitter networks used for this study are extracted from four accounts related to Microsoft Corporation, and together encompass more than 60,000 users and 2 million tweets collected over a period of 32 days. By combining community detection and sentiment analysis, modularity values were increased for the community partitions detected in three of the four networks studied. Furthermore, data collected during the community detection process enabled more granular, community-level sentiment analysis on a specific topic referenced by users in the dataset.}

	abstract = {Background: In public health surveillance, measuring how information enters and spreads through online communities may help us understand geographical variation in decision making associated with poor health outcomes. Objective: Our aim was to evaluate the use of community structure and topic modeling methods as a process for characterizing the clustering of opinions about human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines on Twitter. Methods: The study examined Twitter posts (tweets) collected between October 2013 and October 2015 about HPV vaccines. We tested Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (DMM) models for inferring topics associated with tweets, and community agglomeration (Louvain) and the encoding of random walks (Infomap) methods to detect community structure of the users from their social connections. We examined the alignment between community structure and topics using several common clustering alignment measures and introduced a statistical measure of alignment based on the concentration of specific topics within a small number of communities. Visualizations of the topics and the alignment between topics and communities are presented to support the interpretation of the results in context of public health communication and identification of communities at risk of rejecting the safety and efficacy of HPV vaccines. Results: We analyzed 285,417 Twitter posts (tweets) about HPV vaccines from 101,519 users connected by 4,387,524 social connections. Examining the alignment between the community structure and the topics of tweets, the results indicated that the Louvain community detection algorithm together with DMM produced consistently higher alignment values and that alignments were generally higher when the number of topics was lower. After applying the Louvain method and DMM with 30 topics and grouping semantically similar topics in a hierarchy, we characterized 163,148 (57.16%) tweets as evidence and advocacy, and 6244 (2.19%) tweets describing personal experiences. Among the 4548 users who posted experiential tweets, 3449 users (75.84%) were found in communities where the majority of tweets were about evidence and advocacy. Conclusions: The use of community detection in concert with topic modeling appears to be a useful way to characterize Twitter communities for the purpose of opinion surveillance in public health applications. Our approach may help identify online communities at risk of being influenced by negative opinions about public health interventions such as HPV vaccines. [J Med Internet Res 2016;18(8):e232]}

A careful analysis of this data allows identifying groups of users who share similar traits, opinions, and preferences. We call community detection the process of user group identification, which grants valuable insights not available upfront. In order to extract useful knowledge from Twitter data many methodologies have been proposed, which define the attributes to be used in community detection problems by manual and empirical criteria - oftentimes guided by the aimed type of community and what the researcher attaches importance to. However, such approach cannot be generalized because it is well known that the task of finding out an appropriate set of attributes leans on context, domain, and data set. Aiming to the advance of community detection domain, reduce computational cost and improve the quality of related researches, this paper proposes a standard methodology for community detection in Twitter using feature selection methods.

A sample (N = 738) consisting of activists, sympathizers, and nonactivists, reported past and intended participation in online and offline activism. Using structural equation modeling, it was examined whether online activism was predicted by different factors than offline activism. A wide range of predictors was derived from central theories about mobilization and collective action, including identification, relative deprivation, attitudes, subjective norm, perceived efficacy of action, and self-efficacy. Results show that when compared with offline actions, participation in online actions was slightly more motivated by cognitive calculations (efficacy) and less by affective factors (identification). Moreover, results reflect the popularity and potential of the Internet for activities that surpass the individual. This research gives an empirical insight in the influence of Internet on motives for collective action and on the participation of peripheral members.}

Missing from much of this literature, which has focused broadly on collective action, is attention to the people who seek to bring about social change, activists. Mass collective action is unlikely to occur without the involvement of people to recruit, mobilize, and organize social change campaigns. Including recent research from Australia, Europe, and North and South America, and studies of global online activists, this issue highlights multimethod approaches to studying activists and activism across a variety of different regional, issue-based, and sociopolitical contexts.

The unparalleled rate at which many research groups around the world are releasing data and publications on the ongoing pandemic is allowing other scientists to learn from local experiences and data generated in the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a need to integrate additional data sources that map and measure the role of social dynamics of such a unique world-wide event into biomedical, biological, and epidemiological analyses. For this purpose, we present a large-scale curated dataset of over 152 million tweets, growing daily, related to COVID-19 chatter generated from January 1st to April 4th at the time of writing. This open dataset will allow researchers to conduct a number of research projects relating to the emotional and mental responses to social distancing measures, the identification of sources of misinformation, and the stratified measurement of sentiment towards the pandemic in near real time.}

A popular hypothesis states that networks with many clustered ties and a high degree of separation will be less effective for behavioral diffusion than networks in which locally redundant ties are rewired to provide shortcuts across the social space. A competing hypothesis argues that when behaviors require social reinforcement, a network with more clustering may be more advantageous, even if the network as a whole has a larger diameter. I investigated the effects of network structure on diffusion by studying the spread of health behavior through artificially structured online communities. Individual adoption was much more likely when participants received social reinforcement from multiple neighbors in the social network. The behavior spread farther and faster across clustered-lattice networks than across corresponding random networks. An online experiment shows how network structure affects the spread of health behavior. An online experiment shows how network structure affects the spread of health behavior.}

	abstract = {Directed links in social media could represent anything from intimate friendships to common interests, or even a passion for breaking news or celebrity gossip. Such directed links determine the flow of information and hence indicate a user's influence on others — a concept that is crucial in sociology and viral marketing. In this paper, using a large amount of data collected from Twitter, we present an in-depth comparison of three measures of influence: indegree, retweets, and mentions. Based on these measures, we investigate the dynamics of user influence across topics and time. We make several interesting observations. First, popular users who have high indegree are not necessarily influential in terms of spawning retweets or mentions. Second, most influential users can hold significant influence over a variety of topics. Third, influence is not gained spontaneously or accidentally, but through concerted effort such as limiting tweets to a single topic. We believe that these findings provide new insights for viral marketing and suggest that topological measures such as indegree alone reveals very little about the influence of a user.}

This article introduces a model of interdependent decision making within social networks, in which individuals have heterogeneous motivations to participate, and networks are defined via a qualitative typology mirroring common empirical contexts. The analysis finds that some metrics for networks' influence-size, the prevalence of weak ties, the presence of elites-have a more complex interaction with network structure and individual motivations than has been previously acknowledged. For example, in some contexts additional network ties decrease participation. This presents the potential for selection bias in empirical studies. The model offers a fuller characterization of the role of network structure and predicts expected levels of participation across network types and distributions of motivations as a function of network size, weak and strong ties, and elite influence.}

To answer these questions, we analyzed a large Twitter activity dataset for the #YoSoy132 student uprising in Mexico and Brazil’s “bus rebellion.” Results indicate that individuals initially took prominence at the protests but faded in importance as the movements dwindled and organizations took over. Regarding the dynamics and structure of the interactions, we found that key time points with unique social structures often map to exogenous events such as coordinated protests in physical locations. Our results have important consequences for the visibility of such social movements and their ability to attract continued participation by individuals and organizations.}

Opposition to vaccination with a future vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, for example, could amplify outbreaks2–4, as happened for measles in 20195,6. Homemade remedies7,8 and falsehoods are being shared widely on the Internet, as well as dismissals of expert advice9–11. There is a lack of understanding about how this distrust evolves at the system level13,14. Here we provide a map of the contention surrounding vaccines that has emerged from the global pool of around three billion Facebook users. Its core reveals a multi-sided landscape of unprecedented intricacy that involves nearly 100 million individuals partitioned into highly dynamic, interconnected clusters across cities, countries, continents and languages. Although smaller in overall size, anti-vaccination clusters manage to become highly entangled with undecided clusters in the main online network, whereas pro-vaccination clusters are more peripheral. Our theoretical framework reproduces the recent explosive growth in anti-vaccination views, and predicts that these views will dominate in a decade. Insights provided by this framework can inform new policies and approaches to interrupt this shift to negative views. Our results challenge the conventional thinking about undecided individuals in issues of contention surrounding health, shed light on other issues of contention such as climate change11, and highlight the key role of network cluster dynamics in multi-species ecologies15.}

We examine that connection using data from the surge of mobilizations that took place in Spain in May 2011. We study recruitment patterns in the Twitter network and find evidence of social influence and complex contagion. We identify the network position of early participants (i.e. the leaders of the recruitment process) and of the users who acted as seeds of message cascades (i.e. the spreaders of information). We find that early participants cannot be characterized by a typical topological position but spreaders tend to be more central in the network. These findings shed light on the connection between online networks, social contagion and collective dynamics and offer an empirical test to the recruitment mechanisms theorized in formal models of collective action.}

Although the study of such collective conduct was once considered central to social science, this has long ceased to be the case and in many respects the study of protest and riot now receives relatively little attention, especially within criminology. In addition to offering a critical overview of work in this field, this review argues in favor of an expanded conception of its subject matter. In recent times, scholarly concern has increasingly been focused on questions of etiology, i.e., asking how and why events such as riots occur, with the consequence that less attention is paid to other, arguably equally important questions, including how riots spread, how they end, and, critically, what happens in their aftermath. Accordingly, as a corrective, the review proposes a life-cycle model of riots.}

	abstract = {It is well known that utterances convey a great deal of information about the speaker in addition to their semantic content. One such type of information consists of cues to the speaker’s personality traits, the most fundamental dimension of variation between humans. Recent work explores the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic variation in text and conversation, such as emotion, deception, speaker charisma, dominance, point of view, subjectivity, opinion and sentiment. Personality aﬀects these other aspects of linguistic production, and thus personality recognition may be useful for these tasks, in addition to many other potential applications. However, to date, there is little work on the automatic recognition of personality traits. This article reports experimental results for recognition of all Big Five personality traits, in both conversation and text, utilising both self and observer ratings of personality. While other work reports classiﬁcation results, we experiment with classiﬁcation, regression and ranking models. For each model, we analyse the eﬀect of diﬀerent feature sets on accuracy. Results show that for some traits, any type of statistical model performs signiﬁcantly better than the baseline, but ranking models perform best overall. We also present an experiment suggesting that ranking models are more accurate than multi-class classiﬁers for modelling personality. In addition, recognition models trained on observed personality perform better than models trained using selfreports, and the optimal feature set depends on the personality trait. A qualitative analysis of the learned models conﬁrms previous ﬁndings linking language and personality, while revealing many new linguistic markers.}

	abstract = {Personality analysis has been widely used in various social services such as mental healthcare, recommendation systems and so on because its natural explainability for AI applications in Web intelligence. With the penetration of Web2.0, traditional social researches have gradually turned to online social networks. However, for a long time, personality detection from online social texts has sunk into an embarrassing situation for the lack of large labeled datasets. Limited by supervised learning frameworks and small labeled datasets, prior works mainly detect one’s personality in the individual perspective, which may not well meet the challenges of massive un-labeled data in the near future. In this paper, we present a first look into group-level personality detection and we use an unsupervised feature learning method instead of supervised methods used in most related works. We propose AdaWalk, a new and novel model of group-level personality detection by learning the influence from text generated networks. The model uses different kernels to evaluate how much a given node should decide its walk path locally or globally. The advantage of AdaWalk is three-folded: a) the model is an unsupervised feature learning method, which means it relies less on annotations. b) by traversing the network, we can capture the influence in the group level, thus the analysis of one’s personality is not only based on individual records but also the information in groups. Therefore, AdaWalk can leverage small datasets more comprehensively. c) AdaWalk is scalable and can be easily transformed as distributed algorithms, which means it has more potential, compared with existing personality detection methods, to meet the massive data without annotations. We use AdaWalk to predict users’ Big Five personality scores in FIVE heterogeneous personality datasets. Compared with more than TEN famous related methods, AdaWalk outperforms the others, meanwhile verifying the significance of the group perspective and unsupervised feature learning methods in the application of personality analysis. To make our experiment repeatable, AdaWalk and related datasets are available at https://xiangguosun.strikingly.com.}

For each of the five traits, the authors train a separate binary classifier, with identical architecture, based on a novel document modeling technique. Namely, the classifier is implemented as a specially designed deep convolutional neural network, with injection of the document-level Mairesse features, extracted directly from the text, into an inner layer. The first layers of the network treat each sentence of the text separately; then the sentences are aggregated into the document vector. Filtering out emotionally neutral input sentences improved the performance. This method outperformed the state of the art for all five traits, and the implementation is freely available for research purposes.}

	abstract = {Recent years have brought a significant growth in the volume of research in sentiment analysis, mostly on highly subjective text types (movie or product reviews). The main difference these texts have with news articles is that their target is clearly defined and unique across the text. Following different annotation efforts and the analysis of the issues encountered, we realised that news opinion mining is different from that of other text types. We identified three subtasks that need to be addressed: definition of the target; separation of the good and bad news content from the good and bad sentiment expressed on the target; and analysis of clearly marked opinion that is expressed explicitly, not needing interpretation or the use of world knowledge. Furthermore, we distinguish three different possible views on newspaper articles - author, reader and text, which have to be addressed differently at the time of analysing sentiment. Given these definitions, we present work on mining opinions about entities in English language news, in which (a) we test the relative suitability of various sentiment dictionaries and (b) we attempt to separate positive or negative opinion from good or bad news. In the experiments described here, we tested whether or not subject domain-defining vocabulary should be ignored. Results showed that this idea is more appropriate in the context of news opinion mining and that the approaches taking this into consideration produce a better performance.}

The data track Twitter activity around the protests that took place in May 2011, which led to the formation of camp sites in dozens of cities all over the country and massive daily demonstrations during the week prior to the elections of May 22. We reconstruct the network of tens of thousands of users and monitor their message activity for a month (April 25, 2011, to May 25, 2011). Using both the structure of the network and levels of activity in message exchange, we identify four types of users and analyze their role in the growth of the protest. Drawing from theories of online activism and research on information diffusion in networks, this article centers on the following two questions: How does protest information spread in online networks? And how do different actors contribute to the growth of activity? The article aims to inform the theoretical debate on whether digital technologies are changing the logic of collective action and to provide evidence of how new media facilitates the emergence of massive offline mobilizations.}

@article{Zachary2015,
	abstract = {Large-scale protests occur frequently and sometimes overthrow entire political systems. Meanwhile, online social networks have become an increasingly common component of people’s lives. We present a large-scale longitudinal study that connects online social media behaviors to offline protest. Using almost 14 million geolocated tweets and data on protests from 16 countries during the Arab Spring, we show that increased coordination of messages on Twitter using specific hashtags is associated with increased protests the following day. The results also show that traditional actors like the media and elites are not driving the results. These results indicate social media activity correlates with subsequent large-scale decentralized coordination of protests, with important implications for the future balance of power between citizens and their states.}

	abstract = {This work focuses on detecting emerging civil unrest events by analyzing massive micro-blogging streams. Specifically, we propose an early detection system consisting of a novel cascade of text-based filters to identify civil unrest event posts based on their topics, times and locations. In contrast to the model-based prediction approaches, our method is purely extractive as it detects relevant posts from massive volumes of data directly. We design and implement such a system in a distributed framework for scalable processing of real world data streams. Subsequently, a large-scale experiment is carried out on our system with the entire dataset from Tumblr for three consecutive months. Experimental result indicates that the simple filter-based method provides an efficient and effective way to identify posts related to real world civil unrest events. While similar tasks have been investigated in different social media platforms (e.g., Twitter), little work has been done for Tumblr despite its popularity. Our analysis on the data also shed light on the collective micr-oblogging patterns of Tumblr.}

	abstract = {Social Unrest Reconnaissance Gazetteer (or SURGE) is a Web-based application that provides an open system to visualize and integrate spatio-temporal data about social unrest events with related data layers in South Asia to facilitate data-driven as well as model-based investigations and analyses. Currently, the system displays eight categories of unrest, based primarily on the Global Database of Events, Language and Tone (GDELT) and the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). Users have the ability to select a single day or a range of dates along with the category of unrest they are interested to investigate. The users also have the option to normalize the raw event counts by population density. Additionally, the users can view infrastructure layers that facilitate or hinder the diffusion of unrest events (e.g., collated from an open GIS data-source: OpenStreetMap (www.openstreetmap.org)) and choropleth layers to display various socio-economic indicators (e.g., derived from global surveys and government census data such as the 2011 India census data (cenusindia.gov.in) and IPUMS Terra (data.terrapop.org)). Currently, SURGE displays unrest events for India, Pakistan and Bangladesh as heat map layers in multiple spatial resolutions. Challenges have involved geo-synchronization, data conversions, and displaying multiple layers of dense geospatial datasets. Future capabilities include automatic ingestion of raw data and standardizing levels of unrest using significant predictors.}

We train a supervised classiﬁer that is able to label Arabic language tweets as relevant to unrest with high reliability.

We also explore how conﬁdence thresholds can be set to achieve desired levels of performance.}

We consider the process called mobilization, described in the literature as the precursor of participation. Mobilization includes four stages: being sympathetic to the cause, being aware of the movement, motivation to take part and ability to participate. We suggest that expressions of mobilization in communications of individuals may be used to predict the approaching protest. We have utilized several Natural Language Processing techniques to create a methodology to identify mobilization in social media communication.}

Most existing approaches comparatively pay little attention to considering the event development stages. In this paper, we use autocoded events dataset GDELT (Global Data on Events, Location, and Tone) to build a Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) based framework to predict indicators associated with country instability. The framework utilizes the temporal burst patterns in GDELT event streams to uncover the underlying event development mechanics and formulates the social unrest event prediction as a sequence classification problem based on Bayes decision. Extensive experiments with data from five countries in Southeast Asia demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, which outperforms the logistic regression method by 7% to 27% and the baseline method 34% to 62% for various countries.}

@article{Chenoweth2017,
	abstract = {Despite the prevalence of nonviolent uprisings in recent history, no existing scholarship has produced a generalized explanation of when and where such uprisings are most likely to occur. Our primary aim in this article is to evaluate whether different available models—namely, grievance approaches, modernization theory, resource mobilization theory, and political opportunity approaches—are useful in explaining the onset of major nonviolent uprisings. We assemble a reduced list of correlates based on each model and use each model’s out-of-sample area under the curve and logarithmic score to test each theory’s explanatory power. We find that the political opportunity model performs best for both in- and out-of-sample cases, though grievance and resource mobilization approaches also provide some explanatory power. We use a culled model of the predicted probabilities of the strongestperforming variables from all models to forecast major nonviolent uprisings in 2011 and 2012. In this out-of-sample test, all models produce mixed results, suggesting greater emphasis on agency over structure in explaining these episodes.}

It must, however, be supplemented by additional theory from outside sources to enable calibration to a historical data set. Parameter and policy analyses are conducted. These highlight the criticality of some features of insurgencies described by FM 3-24 such as the importance of obtaining and maintaining popular support and employing sufficient counterinsurgency forces to gather intelligence. Other features, not highlighted by FM 3-24, also are shown to be important such as how quickly does violence escalate during the insurgency and how easily can detained/eliminated insurgents be replaced. Finally, contraindicating the expectations of FM 3-24 and other conventional wisdom, results from optimization simulations suggest that the level of force used in a counterinsurgency should increase only once a preparatory period of intelligence gathering by those same forces has been completed.}

The machine with the longest average uninterrupted active period is considered the bottleneck. The method is widely applicable and also capable of analyzing complex and sophisticated systems. The results are highly accurate, distinguishing between bottleneck machines and non-bottleneck machines with a high level of confidence. This approach is very easy to use and can be implemented into existing simulation tools with little effort, requiring only an analysis of the log file which is readily available by almost all simulation tools. This method satisfies not only academic requirements with respect to accuracy but also industry requirements with respect to usability.}
